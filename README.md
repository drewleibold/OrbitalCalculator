# Orbital Calculator
Welcome! I wanna do something fun with my first time in C++, so I am combining my passion in Astrodynamics with my passion of programming. I am going to implement a numerical propogation thingy mcbobber (there is probably a library for it but I don't care). Then, I want the data from the propogation as well as the graph of the propogation (I will use a plotting library for this). From here, I want to see if I can push a text file with commands to give to the spacecraft to execute as it flies once we have the numerical propogator (propogater?) do it's thing to the dynamical system state space thingy.
## How to use this thing
I don't know yet. I will get back to you on that.
